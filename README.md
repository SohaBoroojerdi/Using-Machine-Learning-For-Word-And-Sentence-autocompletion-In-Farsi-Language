Using Machine Learning For Word And Sentence autocompletion In Farsi Language

Machine learning is an effective method to increase the precision and usability of technology. Textual word and sentence autocompletion is a method that forecasts the rest of a word that a user is typing. A machine learning algorithm can predict a word in context after the user has used it a few times. Word autocompletion allows users to type faster with less spelling mistakes. Farsi is one of the languages that has a variety of letters that sound the same or similar to an English-speaker. For example \faq{ط}, \faq{ت} are equivalent to the "T" sound in English. A seemingly small mistake in spelling would change the word: \faq{حیاط} means yard while \faq{حیات} means life.
We think word and sentence autocompletion is a very useful first step toward creating a collection of datasets that can enable and enhance NLP (natural language processing) and other research typical of what we see in English. The main goal for this research was to create a framework that automatically completes Persian words and sentences. To achieve our second goal, We developed tool with a graphical user interface that allows the user to completes Persian word and sentence automatically with the help of machine learning algorithms such as K Nearest neighbor(KNN) and Long Short Term Memory(LSTM).
